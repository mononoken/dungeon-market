# # Dungeon Market

![A screenshot showing a preview of the cart system.](./public/cart-screenshot.png "Project Preview")

Dungeon Market is beginning as a shopping cart application. You can add monsters to your cart dynamically with costs shown based on the CR of the monsters.

However, the next step is to delve further. I envision it as a tool to help DMs prepare scenarios for their campaigns. DMs can build "carts" of monsters to prepare encounters. Quickly view the CR of the monsters and the encounter.
